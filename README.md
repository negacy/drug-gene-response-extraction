TOWARD SCREENING FALSE POSITIVES IN SYNTHETIC LETHAL SCREENS WITH TEXT MINING

Three drugs of interest:
* Cisplatin
* Gemcitabine
* Paclitaxel

Goal: to extract genes that are sensitive/resistant to these drugs.

299 unique genes:
Targeting BRCA1-BER deficient breast cancer by ATM or DNA-PKcs blockade either alone or in combination with cisplatin for personalized therapy.
BRCA2 inhibition enhances cisplatin-mediated alterations in tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, and metastasis.
The cytoprotective role of gemcitabine-induced autophagy associated with apoptosis inhibition in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

Keyword based document collection
We used three drugs and their synonyms as keywords to search PubMed/MEDLINE to filter abstracts  that potentially contain drug-gene mechanisms.
An example of a query on PubMed: 
(Paclitaxel OR 7-Epipaclitaxel OR 7-Epitaxol OR 7-epi-Paclitaxel OR 7-epi-Taxol OR abi-007 OR Abraxane OR Epitaxol OR LipoPac OR Onxol OR Paxceed OR Paxene OR Taxol OR Taxol A OR Xorane)
